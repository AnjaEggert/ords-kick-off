# Workshop Materials: Reproducible Data Science with RMarkdown

This repository contains the materials used in the workshop **"Reproducible statistical data analysis with R and RMarkdown"** that took place as part of the kick-off event of the [ORDS graduate network](https://www.uni-rostock.de/forschung/nachwuchsfoerderung/graduiertenakademie/netzwerke/ords/) at the University of Rostock in December 2020.
It extends the workshop given by Max Schröder and Frank Krüger that is published at https://github.com/m6121/Workshop-ORDS-Reproducible-Data-Science.

Publishing not only the results, but also source code and data is central in the discussion about open science and the FAIR principles.
Literate programming is the concept of interweaving documentation, code, and data and, thus, fosters the publication of a comprehensive document containing not only the results of a research analysis, but the analysis itself.
RMarkdown documents are a lightweight implementation of this concept.
This workshop introduces RMarkdown with simple statistical examples.


## Usage
The RMarkdown document can be rendered to an html format (or pdf, GitHub markdown and more) using the `R knitr` package.
